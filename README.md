# SusLang

A simple among-us-themed esolang written in C#.<br>
You can find an online interpreter [here](http://api.zenonet.de/SusLang/0.4/)

## The file format

SusLang is an interpreted language which means that there are no compiled SusLang-files. 
The only file format this language uses is the .sus format for source code files

## The syntax

The syntax explanation has moved to [this](https://github.com/zenonet/SusLang/blob/master/syntax.md) markdown file.
