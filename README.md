# SusLang
A simple among-us-themed esolang written in C#

I made this in 4 hours because I was bored. I suggest not trying it out, it isn't fun, this language doesn't even support loops
I might add loops when I am bored again.

<h2>The syntax</h2>
Every statement is exactly one line. You can select a variable using `sus` and a color.
There are 18 variables you can use called after the colors shown [here](https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Colors) however they need to be written in lowercase
For example you can select cyan using `sus cyan`
<br>
Every color/variable can hold an integer value of the size one byte so a number from 0 to 255</br>
Using the statement `emergencyMeeting` you can output the value of the currently selected color/variable encoded into ASCII
